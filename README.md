# Github Jobs API

This small web app project utilizies Github's API to fetch jobs. The web app allows you to filter jobs by keyword, location, and full-time employment positions.

#### Tips for running the project:

1. clone the repo
2. run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. navigate to [CORS Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) and click on "request temporary access to the demo server"

> CORS Anywhere helps with accessing data from other websites that is normally forbidden by the same origin policy of web browsers. This is done by proxying requests to these sites via a server (written in Node.js, in this case).

##### What I used to create this project:

- Axios
- Bootstrap
- Javascript ES6
- ReactJS
